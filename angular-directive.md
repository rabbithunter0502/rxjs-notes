1. Components — directives with a template.
2. Structural directives — change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.
3. Attribute directives — change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

When we say that components are the building blocks of Angular applications, we are actually saying that directives are the building blocks of Angular applications.
